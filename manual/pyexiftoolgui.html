This manual is for pyexiftoolgui (version 0.32, January 2013).
pyExifToolGui is a python pySide QT4 script program that reads and writes
exif, xmp and IPTC tags from/to image files. It can use areference" image as source image to
copy data from. A strong point of this software is the ability to write the data,
copied or not from a source image, to multiple images at once.

<h2 class="unnumbered">pyExifToolGUI</h2>

<p>This manual is for pyExifToolGUI (version 0.32, January 2013).
pyExifToolGui is a python pySide QT4 script program that reads and writes metadata like
exif, xmp, gps, gpano tags from/to image files. It can use a "reference" image as source image to
copy data from. A strong point of this software is the ability to write the data,
copied or not from a source image, to multiple images at once.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<!-- Undo the roman page numbering we used for the Table-of-Contents, -->
<!-- the List-of-Tables, and the List-of-Figures. -->
<p>pyExifToolGui is a python pySide QT4 script program that reads and writes
exif, gps, xmp, gpano (and a very limited set of IPTC) tags from/to image files using exiftool. 
pyExifToolGUI: py for python, GUI for Graphical User Interface to ExifTool.


<p>pyExifToolGui is a graphical frontend for the excellent open source
command line tool <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/" target="_blank">ExifTool</a> by Phil Harvey.
pyExifToolGui is not a complete ExifTool Gui, far from that.
I needed a tool to add gps data to my images and couldn't find one
and decided to write my own. 
So the main goal for this tool was the ability to write gps data to photos as I 
photograph a lot in buildings like Churches/Cathedrals and Musea (when allowed), 
which means that the gps functionality of the camera doesn't function.
In the mean time the functionality of pyExifToolGUI has expanded and also supports reading, writing and exporting 
all kind of metadata. Next to that it now contains also extended photo file renaming functionality 
based on the exif info in your photos.
By now pyExifToolGUI is a general exiftool Gui but it is still far from complete.
<p>This pyExifToolGUI tool is also a geotagging tool since version 0.4!

<p>IPTC tags are only partly supported. IPTC is an older and slowly deminishing metadata standard being replaced by xmp. Where
applicable, e.g. redundant tags in xmp, the iptc tags will be updated simultaneously.
<p>This program is Open Source and completely free and will always stay that way, but you can donate any amount to me to show
your appreciation. See the Help menu in the program or the donate button below.

<h3 class="section">1.1 This manual and the pyExifToolGUI version</h3>

<p>This manual and the pyExifToolGUI version might not always run synchronously. If new functionality 
is added to the program which requires a new chapter or paragraph, the manual will be updated for that new section.
However, not all parts of the manual will/might be updated which might lead to older program screens in the manual that might 
slightly deviate from the program version you will be working with.<br>
Note also that you will see screen captures from several operating systems (Linux/Windows/Mac OS X) and/or window managers (on Linux).

<hr>
<p><a name="Installation"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">2 Installation</h2>

<p>This tool is written for Linux and primarily aimed at Linux.
However, it runs fine and functions fine on Mac OS X and Windows as well 
for which, respectively, a program bundle and an executable is available for download.
pyExifToolGUI is currently not part of any Linux distribution and I'm currently lacking 
the skills to write a distutils or exportutils (or good automake/configure) 
script to package it for Ubuntu (or any other Debian based linux), 
or (Open)Suse or Fedora/Redhat.
This also means that it doesn't do any dependency checks for necessary
libraries and so on. 
I wrote a simple "setup" script that takes care of installation and removal. 
This setup script is for Linux but can also be used on Mac OS X. 
<p><b>Note:</b> pyExifToolGUI comes without exiftool which you need to download yourself from Phil Harvey's 
<a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/" target="blank">exiftool site</a> if you want the latest version. 
On Linux you can also use the version belonging to your distribution.
<p> For Mac OS X you can either run the simple pyExifToolGUI.app bundle (via the setup script) from the tar.gz and install the 
dependencies yourself, or you can download the full bundle which includes everything internally.
<p>For Windows a python executable has been created (Note to Windows users: Currently there is the 
closed sourced but free exiftoolgui for windows. pyexiftoolgui contains the functionality 
of applying your changes to a selected set of images at once, exiftoolgui only has 
this on a limited set of tags. The total "functionality set" of exiftoolgui is currently
more then that of pyexiftoolgui, but it misses the new GPano functionality 
(see <a href="#EditgpanoData">paragraph 5.4</a>).

<p>You can run pyexiftoolgui without installing it: see <a href="#NoInstall">paragraph 2.4</a> below the
installation instructions. 


<p><a name="InstallLinux"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.1 Installation on Linux</h3>
<p>Dependencies (Meaning that you need to install them yourself):
<ul><li>python: part of every linux system, so always available, but >=2.6 required.
<li>pyside: Install via your distribution's package manager. Otherwise download it from www.pyside.org
<li>python-pyside (qtcore, qtgui and qtuitools are required): Install via your distribution's package manager. 
  <br>Otherwise download it from www.pyside.org
<li>ExifTool: Install via your distribution's package manager.</li></ul>

<p>Installation:
<ul><li>Untar the package to some folder.
<li>Open a terminal and move into the folder where you untarred the pyExifToolGui-x.y.tgz
<li>pyExiftoolGUI <= 0.31: Run the setup script from the command line with <PRE>sudo ./setup.py install</PRE>.
<li>pyExiftoolGUI >= 0.32: Run the setup script from the command line with <PRE>sudo ./install_remove.py install</PRE>.
<li>pyExifToolGUI will be installed and you should have an icon in your menu under the Graphics sub menu
 or in your Dash (Ubuntu).
<li>Start and enjoy.</li></ul>

<p><a name="InstallMacOSX"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.2 Installation on Mac OS X</h3>

<p>You have two options for installation on Mac OS X

<p><a name="InstallMacOSXFullBundle"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 Full application bundle</h4>
<p>Download the dmg with the full pyexiftoolgui.app bundle. Open the dmg and copy the pyexiftoolgui.app to a place of 
your liking where /Applications is of course the most suitable location.
<p> </p>

<p><a name="InstallMacOSXSimpleBundle"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.2.2 Simple application bundle (install dependencies yourself)</h4>

<p>Dependencies (Meaning that you need to install them yourself):
<ul><li>python: part of every linux system, so always available, but 2.7 required.
  <ul><li>(Snow) Leopard: Download python 2.7 from python.org and install. Then run the
     "Update Shell Profile.command" from <span style="white-space: nowrap;">/Applications/Python 2.7</span>
  <li>(Mountain) Lion comes with python 2.7</li></ul>
<li>pyside: Download it from www.pyside.org. (You can also install it from MacPorts but this will give issues most of the time.)
<li>pyX.Y-pyside: Install via MacPorts. (XY needs to be 2.7).
<li>ExifTool: Download the DMG from the ExifTool website (highly preferred) or install via MacPorts.</li></ul>

<p>Installation:
<ul><li>Untar the package to some folder.
<li>Open a terminal and move into the folder where you untarred the pyExifToolGui-x.y.tgz
<li>pyExiftoolGUI <= 0.31: Run the setup script from the command line with <PRE>sudo ./setup.py install</PRE>.
<li>pyExiftoolGUI >= 0.32: Run the setup script from the command line with <PRE>sudo ./install_remove.py install</PRE>.
<li>The script will install a "bare bones" pyExifToolGUI.app in your Applications folder.
  Note that the pyExifToolGUI.app is NOT a complete self contained application. It needs the mentioned dependencies.
<li>Start and enjoy.</li></ul>


<p><a name="InstallWindows"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Installation on Windows</h3>

<p>For windows an executable has been created. This could be easily packaged with some
open source installer like INNOsetup, but for the moment it is simply packaged in a 
zip file. Unzip the zip archive to some folder of your liking and start it. This also means
that the package does not create registry entries.
<b>Note:</b> As mentioned in the intro: pyExifToolGUI comes without exiftool itself. If you download it, the default 
version for windows is called exiftool(-k).exe. Always rename this to exiftool.exe as the exiftool(-k).exe version pauses after every screen of output and requires a keypress to continue: You don't want that.
(Tip: If you only see exiftool(-k) without an extension in you file manager then simply rename it to exiftool).





<p><a name="NoInstall"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.4 Run pyexiftoolgui from download folder (No Installation)</h3>

<p>You can run pyexiftoolgui without installing it. 

<p>- Linux/MacOSX
<ul><li> Make sure you have the dependecies installed as described above in the subsections.
<li>From this folder, start in a terminal: <PRE>$ ./bin/pyexiftoolgui</PRE></li></ul>

<p>- Windows
<ul><li>Make sure you have the dependecies installed as described above in the Windows subsection.
<li>From this folder, start in a command-box (dos-box): python bin/pyexiftoolgui
   (If python is not in your path, provide the full path to it)</li></ul>


<p><a name="UnInstall"></a>

<h3 class="section">Uninstall / Removal</h3>
<ul><li>Open a terminal
<li>Move into the folder where you untarred the pyExifToolGUI.<version>.tgz (You might need to download again if your removed everything).
<li>pyExiftoolGUI <= 0.31: run the setup script from the command line with <PRE>$ sudo ./setup.py remove</PRE>.
<li>pyExiftoolGUI >= 0.32: run the setup script from the command line with <PRE>$ sudo ./install_remove.py remove</PRE>.
<li>On Mac OS X simply remove pyExifToolGUI.app from /Applications</li>
<li>On Windows simply remove the folder containing the pyexiftoolgui.exe application.</ul>
<p> <br></p>



<hr><p><a name="GeneralUsage"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">3 General Usage</h2>

<p>The program consists of a left pane containing your photos, and a right pane which consists of a set of tabs. One of these tabs contains a subset of tabs.
Next to the tabs on the right the program also has an "Extra" menu which contains another set of functionalities.
A number of buttons and functions will not work, and are disabled, untill you have loaded at least one photo.
Most actions on your images which you perform in the right tabs or in the Extra menu, only work after having selected at least one, or more of the loaded photos in the left pane.

<h4>View data</h4>
<p>Select an image and simply click one of the radiobuttons. If you have multiple images selected, the metadata for the last selected image will be displayed.

<h4>Edit data</h4>
<p>Here as well: All actions in the right "Edit" tab only work after having selected one or more of the loaded photos.
<ul>
<li>You can select one image and modify the data for it.
<li>You can select multiple images at once and modify the data for all these images at once.
<li>You can select one image, copy data from it, then select multiple images, and paste the (copied) data to these multiple images at once.
</ul>

<h4>"Extra" menu</h4>
<p>This is not a tab, but a sub-menu from the main menu. A few options can only be used in conjunction with the Context menu.
<p><img title="Extra menu" src="extramenu.jpg" alt="Extra menu">

<p><a name="Contextmenu"></a>

<h2 class="section">3.1 Context menu</h2>

<p>The program also contains "context menu" functionality, which is more generally known as "right-click" functionality. This functionality can be very handy in some situations as it reduces mouse (kilo)meters.
Without photos loaded, you will have a "mini" menu. With photos loaded you will get a larger context menu containing image related functions.<br>
<table border="0" cellpadding="30">
<tr>
<td><img title="Context menu without photos loaded" src="contextmenu1.jpg" alt="Context menu without photos loaded"><br>Context menu without photos loaded.</td>
<td><img title="Context menu with photos loaded" src="contextmenu2.jpg" alt="Context menu with photos loaded"><br>Context menu with photos loaded.</td>
</tr>
</table>




<hr><p><a name="ViewData"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">4 View Data</h2>

<p>The "View Data" tab gives you the option to display all available meta data from a photo (image).
You select a photo on the left side and click the radiobutton on the right side to see all or a selected 
set of data of the photo.
As ExifTool supports a large number of image formats, but also movie formats, all available metadata that
ExifTool can read, can be displayed by pyExifToolGUI as well. The file filter, used to select files from the file dialog, 
is by default set to all image types pexiftool supports, but can also be set to the total set of file extensions that exiftool supports (and simply to "All files (*.*)"). Note that some of the data, 
or subsets of data, is simply not available in the non-image formats.<br>
pyExifToolGUI will try to make a preview (thumbnail) of the image, but will not always succeed as most RAW formats are not supported. In case of other
 formats like movies and so on, the creation of a preview will almost certain not function.</p>
<img src="viewdatatab.jpg" alt="viewdatatab.jpg" title="The View Data tab" width="1100">
<p>Note that the "Display Image" button will display the selected image in the default image viewer. If this "image" 
happens to be a movie, the movie will be displayed in the default movie/media viewer if the format is supported. (Right-click ->Display image works as well).
<p>Image rotation is not always correctly "interpreted" by the underlying QT image plugins that create the 
preview thumbnails. If you think it is not correct you can simply select the image, click on the "Display Image" button 
and see whether your "normal" image viewer displays it correctly, meaning that your image has the correct setting.
<p>

<hr><p><a name="EditData"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">5 Edit Data</h2>

<p>The application is a so called "tabbed" application. The "Edit Data" tab is the (obvious) tab
that contains the sub tabs with all the edit options. Currently a moderate set of tabs have been 
defined but the order, number and even content can change during the further development of this application.

<p><a name="EditgpsData"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.1 Edit gps Data</h3>

<p>This tab is used to add GPS data to your images. This tab works on a combination of
exif, xmp and iptc gps data as latitude, longitude and altitude are covered in both the exif and
in the xmp metadata structure. The Location metadata details (Country, Province/State, city, Location) 
are covered by xmp and IPTC. This tab therefore acts on multiple tag categories (exif, xmp and iptc) at once 
and simply tries to make your gps/location data as complete as possible in the 
several tag categories.</p>
<img src="editgpstab.jpg" alt="editgpstab.jpg" title="The Edit gps tab" width="1100">
<ul><li><h3>Buttons working on image(s):</h3>
<ul><li><b>Copy from selected image</b>: This will copy all the (available) gps data from
the selected image into the input fields.</li>
<li><b>Save to selected image(s)</b>: This will save the gps data to your selected image(s).</li></ul></ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> When the "Save" checkbox is enabled, empty fields will write empty values to your image(s). Take this into account!
<ul><li><h3>General buttons:</h3>
<ul><li><b>Reset fields</b>: This will empty all fields and set radiobuttons and checkboxes to their defaults.</li>
<li><b>Open MapCoordinates.net</b>: This will open the mapcoordinates.net website enabling you to get and copy latitude, longitude and altitude data

On Windows and Mac OS X simply install it. On Linux you simply unpack the tar.gz to some
 folder. After the install/unpack you can use the Preferences tab to select that untarred version.</p>
<p><b>Things to take into account!</b></p>
<p>As you can see the options all have a <b>Save</b> checkbox behind their input fields
It means that this option will be saved when checked, even when the field is empty.
This also means that you can:
<ul><li>overwrite existing data with empty data "by accident".</li>
<li>deliberately overwrite existing data with data from empty fields.</li></ul>
<ul><li><h3>Available buttons:</h3>
<ul><li><b>Copy from selected image</b>: This will copy all the (available) exif data from
the selected image into the input fields.</li>
<li><b>Save to selected image(s)</b>: This will save the \"checked\" exif data to your selected image(s).</li>
<li><b>Reset fields</b>: This will empty all fields and set checkboxes to their defaults.</li>
<li><b>Help</b>: This button opens the manual you are currently reading.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p><a name="Geotagging"></a>
<h3 class="section">5.5 Geotagging</h3>
<p>Geotagging adds GPS data to your images based on data from a GPS track log file. This GPS track file can be used from your phone, gps device, navigation device, or whatever you have providing such a GPS track.<br>
The GPS track log file is loaded, and linear interpolation is used to determine the GPS position at the time of the image, then the following tags are written to the image (if the corresponding information is available).
It means that your camera needs to be set correctly with regard to the date/time of the location where you are.<br>
PyExifToolGUI also supports the "Geosync" feature of ExifTool. The Geosync tag is only needed when the image timestamps are not properly synchronized with GPS time.<br>
For example, a value of "+1:20" specifies that 1 minute and 20 seconds is added to the Geotime value before checking with the GPS track file. This is for a camera running 1 minute 20 seconds slower than the GPS clock.<br>
The Geosync time is specified as  "SS", "MM:SS", "HH:MM:SS" or "DD HH:MM:SS" (where SS=seconds, MM=minutes, HH=hours and DD=days), and a leading "+" or "-" may be added for positive or negative differences.<br>
Note: Do not use (double) quotes around the geosync time in pyExifToolGUI. Simply use something like -25 or +1:20</p>
<p>In pyExifToolGUI you have 2 options:
<ol><li>Use (a selection of) the images you loaded in the left images pane.</li>
<li>Specify a folder containing a set of images to be tagged.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>In case of the first option you need to leave the folder empty. If the "Folder containing the images:" is not left empty, it will always be the first option used.<br><br>
Note that pyExifToolGui will write both the EXIF GPS tags as well as the XMP GPS tags.

<p><a name="EditiptcData"></a>
<h3 class="section">5.6 IPTC data (not directly supported)</h3>
<p>IPTC is an older metadata information standard.
It stands for "International Press Telecommunications Council", also with a 
combination with the Newspaper Association of America (NAA) Information Interchange Model (IIM).
This already shows the primary goal of this standard which is perhaps not what 
an amateur photograph is aiming for.
Next to that: IPTC is being phased out in favor of XMP.
<p>On some of the edit tabs the IPTC data is automatically updated when (for example) the xmp data is updated.

<h4 class="subsection">5.7.2 After scanning: Correcting Date/time and Renaming workflow</h4>
<p>The following workflow shows an example where (in this case) old diapositives out of 1977 were scanned. We start with the scanned images and the workflow is as follows:
<ul><li>Set the datetime metatags (We don't know the exact the date so we estimate the date as precise as possible.)
<li>We set the file date based on the datetime metatags we have just set in the previous set.
<li>We rename the photos based on metadata tags and possible string (like the occasion, location or whatever you want to use to identify/classify the photos).
</li></ul>
<p>The following workflow consists of a mix-and-match of Mac OS X screens and Ubuntu Unity screens (the latter with Mac OS X windowing icon theme as I don't like Ubuntu Unity's default orange icons).

added in the previous step and use that as file date/time.
<i>Note</i>: exiftool can go back as far as 01-01-1970 for file dates (metadata can be any date/time). If your images are from e.g. 26 December 1958 (mid day) you need to use the "touch" function on linux/Mac OS X like "touch -t 195812261200.00 name_of_image(s)"

There are two options to use this screen:
<ul><li>Using a (sub)selection from the main screen.
<li>Selecting a source folder in this renaming screen.</li></ul>
= Using a (sub)selection from the main screen</br>
The way of working is described in the last subsection of 5.6.2.<br>
<p>= Selecting a source folder in this renaming screen.<br>
When you use this option the renaming will work on all supported formats in the selected folder and in 
any subfolder of the selected folder.<p>
= What are the differences?<br>
The main screen selection gives you the option to load a set of images from a folder and work sequentially on the subselections. It is therefore more flexible.<br>
The source folder option on the other hand is up to 10 times faster.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td><p><img title="Create args file(s)" src="extramenu-argsfile.jpg" alt="Create args file(s)" align="left">Exiftool has the option to output information in the form of exiftool arguments. If you create an args file by exporting the information from your photo(s), you can use this args file as an "exiftool commands" file to write to another (set of) photo(s). pyExifToolGUI (currently) only supports the creation of these args files. pyExifToolGUI can't use these files (yet) to write to other photos.<br>A workaround however is to use this args file from the "Your commands" tab as explained in chapter <a href="#YourCommands">7 Your commands</a>.</td></tr></table>

<p>Exiftool can export the metadata inside images to a number of output formats. From this popup screen you can 
export the metadata from your selected image(s) to files in these export formats.
<p>Note that per selected image an output (export) file is written (1 photo gives 1 export file). The only exception to this is the 
"csv" format. The "csv" format is an LibreOffice/OpenOffice/Excel compatible format which contains one row of 
metadata per image in one "output.csv"file.<br>

It works on the images you selected in the main screen.<br><p>This dialog gives you more date/time functionality (and only date/time functionality) compared to the exif->edit tab: You can use the "shift above date/times" function to shift the date/time forward or backward (in the future or in the past) for the selected fields. This function also respects whether you selected the specific tag (field) to save or not, and also works on the selected images from the main screen.<br>The "Use date and time from reference image" can also be used in combination with the "shift above date/times" function.<br><p>The corresponding xmp values can be updated at the same time.</td></tr></table>

date/time of your images might have changed to the date when you did your action/modification on the photo(s). In 
such a situation the real filedate(= creation date) of your images is (much) older. You might want to change the file date 
back to what it really should be based on the metadata when you took the photo.<br>
Another option could be that you scanned some old photos, negatives or dia positives. These photos will get the date when they were saved after the scanning. Next to that: these scanned images mostly contain no exif data at all.<br><p>
This "Set file/date time to DateTimeOriginal" function will take the original date/time when the photo was taken from the exif:DateTimeOriginal 
and use that (again) as file date/time.
<br><i>Note:</i> In case you have images that don't contain datetime metadata anymore, or not at all like the scanned photos, you first need to use the "Modify Date/time" function as described in <a href="#extramenu-modifydatetime">6.4 Modify Date/time</a></td></tr></table>

<p>As the popup on the left already mentions: If exiftool can't write to your photo it might be due to corrupted 
metadata. Exiftool can fix a lot of the metadata but only for the tags that are still readible. In a jpeg the image data is separated from the meta data. Exiftool will create a clean metadata structure and write as much metadata back to the metadata part of the JPG.<br>
<i>Note:</i> If your photo can't be displayed in an image viewer, your image data itself is corrupt. Exiftool can't repair 
that.<br>

XMP stands for "Extensible Metadata Platform", an XML/RDF-based metadata format which is being pushed by Adobe. 
Information in this format can be embedded in many different image file types including JPG, JP2, TIFF, GIF, EPS, 
PDF, PSD, IND, INX, PNG, DJVU, SVG, PGF, MIFF, XCF, CRW, DNG and a variety of proprietary TIFF-based RAW images, 
as well as in MOV, AVI, ASF, WMV, FLV, SWF and MP4 videos, but also in WMA and audio formats supporting ID3v2 information.<br>
<p>XMP is a "growing" and easy extensible metadata format and already incorporates a lot of EXIF and IPTC metadata. It also allows for software products to define their own set of XMP tags, like the Google photosphere, microsoft face recognition and Digikam xmp tags.<br>This "Copy all metadata to xmp format" function copies all the relevant information from the exif and iptc tags into the corresponding xmp tags.

<p><img src="yourcommands.jpg" alt="yourcommands.jpg" title="The Your Commands tab" width="1100">
<br>You can both specify read parameters as well as write parameters but not in one command: write actions take precedence. You can also combine several parameters. <b>Note:</b> You don't need (must not) provide the exiftool command itself. The Gui will take care of that.<br> 
One thing YOU need to take care of is the use of either single quotes or double quotes around some commands. If you want to set the file date to the date the photo was taken, you need the command <tt>-FileModifyDate&lt;DateTimeOriginal</tt>.
On Windows you need to double-quote this and on Linux and Mac OS X you need to single-quote this, like
<ul><li>Linux/Mac OS X: <tt>'-FileModifyDate&lt;DateTimeOriginal'</tt></li>
<li>Windows: <tt>"-FileModifyDate&lt;DateTimeOriginal"</tt></li></ul>
Other examples are:

<h2 class="chapter">8 Preferences</h2>

<p>The Preferences tab gives you the option to select some defaults for this application.
<p><h3>ExifTool:</h3>
<ul><li><b>Windows:</b>  You always have to specify where exiftool.exe is. Please rename exiftool(-k).exe to exiftool.exe. 
If you stick to exiftool(-k).exe the program will pause after every screen of output and wait for a key to continue. That will give problems in pyExifToolGUI (in any GUI for that matter).</li>
<li><b>Linux and Mac OS X:</b>  The program will check for an installed exiftool in the standard program folders. 
If not found you have to specify where exiftool is. You can also use this option to specify a newer exiftool version 
then standard available for your distribution. At this moment most Linux distributions ship with some 8.xy exiftool version.
</li></ul>
<p>For the Gpano functionality you really need a version equal or newer then 9.07. 
See also "<a href="#EditgpanoData">5.4 Edit GPano (Google Photosphere) data</a>".
<p><h3>Default values:</h3>
<p>These fields give you the option to specify your name (for example) and some copyright notice (for example: Spiderman (c) 2012).
They can be copied into the relevant exif, xmp and iptc fields for these values.</li></ul>

<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License, which is a
copyleft license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are
listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover
Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the
Title&rdquo; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it
remains a section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if the
original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section.  You may
omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;,
Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are
not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section may not
be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled
&ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;, and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You
must delete all sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to
Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
actual title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
<acronym>GNU</acronym> Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
