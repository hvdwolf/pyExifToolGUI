# pyExifToolGUI

# !!! DISCONTINUED !!!
## I stopped the development of python pyside gui. My latest changes were somewhere in 2015. 
After that time a number of contributors added patches to further expand functionality or to fix bugs.
Contributors were (in alfabetical order): darkdragon-001, emteejay, GadgetSteve, jedi and jejimenez.
I really thank them for their contributions and hope I do not disappoint them too much.

## Please switch to [jExifToolGUI](https://github.com/hvdwolf/jExifToolGUI/releases)!

pyExifToolGui is a python pySide QT4 script program that reads and writes
exif, xmp and IPTC tags from/to image files using exiftool. It can use a
"reference" image as source image to copy data from. 
A strong point of this software is the ability to write the data,
copied or not from a source image, to multiple images at once.
The main goal for this tool was the ability to write gps data to my images as I
photograph a lot in buildings like Churches/Cathedrals and Musea (when allowed),
which means that the gps functionality of the camera doesn't function.
Next to the gps functionality pyExifToolGUI will slowly grow into a general 
exiftool Gui and will also write other tags to your images.
This pyExifToolGUI tool is also a geotagging tool as of version 0.4.

pyExifToolGui is a graphical frontend for the excellent open source
command line tool ExifTool(1) by Phil Harvey.
pyExifToolGui is not a complete ExifTool Gui, far from that.
I needed a tool to add gps data to my images and couldn't find one
and decided to write my own. 
"By accident" it contains more functions as ExifTool is a powerful tool
and once you have written the basic program Gui skeleton it is relatively easy
to add extra functionality, which is basically to add more exif/xmp/iptc 
tags and add them to the "write to image" function. This is a time consuming 
process but not a difficult one.
